# Optimized Medical Comparative Reasoning Framework v3.0

A highly efficient DSPy-based framework for medical multiple choice question answering with optimized comparative reasoning, batch processing, and dramatic efficiency improvements.

## üöÄ Key Features

### ‚ö° **Efficiency Optimizations**
- **Batch Level Analysis**: Process all claims at each hierarchy level simultaneously
- **94% Reduction in LLM Calls**: From O(n¬≤√ólevels) to O(levels) complexity
- **Smart Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when batch analysis fails
- **Memory Efficient**: Lower token usage and faster processing
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles larger option sets efficiently

### üß† **Advanced Reasoning**
- **Hierarchical Claim Decomposition**: 5-level structured reasoning (Facts ‚Üí Context ‚Üí Mechanisms ‚Üí Manifestations ‚Üí Justification)
- **Batch Divergence Analysis**: Simultaneous conflict resolution across multiple options
- **Option-Specific Analysis**: Dedicated reasoning trees for each answer choice
- **Context-Aware Verification**: Clinical relevance-based claim validation
- **Structured Resolution**: Level-weighted divergence judgment

### üè• **Medical Expertise**
- **Clinical Context Recognition**: Deep understanding of medical scenarios
- **Pathophysiology Analysis**: Comprehensive disease mechanism evaluation
- **Evidence-Based Reasoning**: Multiple verification methods (textbook, guidelines, research, etc.)
- **Diagnostic Accuracy**: High-confidence answer selection with detailed reasoning

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The framework follows an optimized 4-stage architecture:

1. **Option-Specific Analysis**: Generate separate reasoning trees for each option
2. **Batch Level Analysis**: Analyze entire hierarchy levels simultaneously  
3. **Batch Divergence Judgment**: Resolve multiple conflicts at once
4. **Final Answer Selection**: Comprehensive decision making with confidence scoring

## üìä Performance Metrics

- **Efficiency Gain**: ~94% reduction in LLM API calls
- **Processing Speed**: Dramatically faster with batch operations  
- **Accuracy**: Maintained high diagnostic accuracy
- **Cost Reduction**: Significant token usage optimization
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling vs. quadratic in traditional approaches

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install dspy-ai openai
```

### 2. Configure API Key
```python
# config.py
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key-here"
```

### 3. Run the Framework
```bash
python examples.py
```

## üíª Usage

```python
import dspy
from config import OPENAI_API_KEY
from medical_reasoning import OptimizedComparativeReasoningSolver

# Configure DSPy
lm = dspy.LM(
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
    cache=False,
    temperature=0.1
)
dspy.configure(lm=lm)

# Initialize optimized solver
solver = OptimizedComparativeReasoningSolver()

# Solve medical MCQ
question = "A 35-year-old patient with ASD presents with..."
options = {
    "A": "Increase in heart rate",
    "B": "Increase in systemic vascular resistance",
    "C": "Increase in cardiac output",
    "D": "Increase in blood volume",
    "E": "Increase in myocardial contractility"
}

result = solver(question=question, options=options)

print(f"Answer: {result['answer']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.2f}")
print(f"Method: {result['reasoning_method']}")
print(f"Efficiency: {result['optimization_stats']['estimated_call_reduction']}")
