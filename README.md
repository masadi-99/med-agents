# Setup
lm = dspy.LM(model="openai/gpt-4o-mini", api_key="your-key")
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
solver = OptimizedComparativeReasoningSolver()

# Analyze any medical MCQ
result = solver(question="Your medical question...", options={"A": "...", "B": "..."})

from config import OPENAI_API_KEY
from medical_reasoning import OptimizedComparativeReasoningSolver

# Configure DSPy
lm = dspy.LM(
    model="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
    cache=False,
    temperature=0.1
)
dspy.configure(lm=lm)

# Initialize optimized solver
solver = OptimizedComparativeReasoningSolver()

# Solve medical MCQ
question = "A 35-year-old patient with ASD presents with..."
options = {
    "A": "Increase in heart rate",
    "B": "Increase in systemic vascular resistance",
    "C": "Increase in cardiac output",
    "D": "Increase in blood volume",
    "E": "Increase in myocardial contractility"
}

result = solver(question=question, options=options)

print(f"Answer: {result['answer']}")

## 🏥 Concrete Medical Case Example

### **Input Case:**
```
A 35-year-old patient with a known large atrial septal defect (ASD) presents with 
increasing shortness of breath and fatigue over the past 6 months. Physical 
examination reveals elevated jugular venous pressure, a systolic murmur, and mild 
peripheral edema. Echocardiography shows dilated right heart chambers with preserved 
left ventricular function. What is the most likely acute physiological change 
responsible for the patient's recent clinical deterioration?

Options:
A) Increase in heart rate
B) Increase in systemic vascular resistance  
C) Increase in cardiac output
D) Increase in blood volume
E) Increase in myocardial contractility
```

### **Framework Output:**
```
🏆 SELECTED ANSWER: A
📊 CONFIDENCE SCORE: 0.72
⚡ REASONING METHOD: optimized_batch_comparative_analysis

📈 ANALYSIS METRICS:
├─ Total Claims Generated: 25
├─ Level Relationships: 13  
├─ Level Divergences: 2
└─ Efficiency Gain: 94.0% reduction in LLM calls

🥇 OPTION PERFORMANCE RANKING:
├─ Option A: 0.72 (Increase in heart rate)
├─ Option C: 0.68 (Increase in cardiac output)  
├─ Option B: 0.00 (Increase in systemic vascular resistance)
├─ Option D: 0.00 (Increase in blood volume)
└─ Option E: 0.00 (Increase in myocardial contractility)

🧠 KEY REASONING:
The framework identified that in ASD patients, compensatory tachycardia 
(increased heart rate) is the primary acute physiological response to 
right heart failure and decreased stroke volume. This was determined 
through hierarchical analysis of:
├─ Basic facts about ASD pathophysiology
├─ Physiological context of left-to-right shunting
├─ Pathophysiological mechanisms of volume overload
├─ Clinical manifestations of right heart failure
└─ Answer justification based on compensatory mechanisms
```
